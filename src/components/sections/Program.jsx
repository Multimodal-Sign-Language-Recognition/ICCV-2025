        title: "Delivering Sign Language AI at Scale: From Synthetic Data to Real-World Use",
        abstract: "In this keynote, we share our journey toward making sign language technologies a core part of Microsoft’s accessibility efforts—particularly in enhancing communication experiences for Deaf and sign language users in Microsoft Teams. We highlight the transformative role of synthetic data in overcoming the scarcity of annotated sign language datasets, enabling scalable, inclusive, and diverse training resources. By leveraging time-synchronized multi-view capture, precise registration, and rendering pipelines, we generate richly labeled synthetic data across varied identities and environments. We advocate for community-driven multi-view data collection and emphasize that zero-shot evaluation—without fine-tuning—is the true benchmark for real-world deployment. This talk outlines our key learnings and invites collaboration to advance sign language technology for all.",
